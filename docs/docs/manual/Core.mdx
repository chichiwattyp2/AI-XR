import {CodeSearchLink} from './components/CodeSearchLink.jsx';

XR Blocks SDK is wrapped around a singleton instance of `Core` exported as `core`.

The `Core` object is resposible for:
1. Setup of all components such as the renderer, scene, input, depth, physics, simulator, etc.
2. Calling lifecycle functions in all [`Script`](Scripts.md) entities and XR Blocks components.

## Init

To initialize the `Core` object, call `xb.init()` or `xb.init(options)` with a provided set of options.

For a set of options, see <CodeSearchLink path="sdk/core/XROptions.js"/>.

For example:
```js
import * as xb from 'xrblocks';

const options = new xb.Options();
xb.init(options);
```
