# Getting Started

XR Blocks is a lightweight, cross-platform library for rapidly prototyping
advanced XR and AI experiences. Built upon [three.js](https://threejs.org), it
targets Chrome v136+ with WebXR support on Android XR. XR Blocks supports XR
and desktop platforms, emphasizing a user-centric, developer-friendly SDK.

## Importing XR Blocks

For a starter template, take a look at <CodeSearchLink path="templates/0_basic/index.html"/>.

XR Blocks can be imported directly into a webpage using a importmap or a bundler.

To use an importmap, simply add the following importmap to your `index.html` page.

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.180.0/build/three.module.js",
      "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.180.0/examples/jsm/",
      "xrblocks": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/google/xrblocks@build/xrblocks.js",
      "xrblocks/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/google/xrblocks@build/addons/"
    }
  }
</script>
```

Upon importing, XR Blocks automatically creates an `Core` singleton which will initialize a basic renderer and manage the lifecycle of the app.

## Setting up the scene.

Create a JS module which imports the XR Blocks to access the scene:

```javascript
import * as xb from "xrblocks";

// Initialize the XR Core object to create a renderer and scene.
xb.init();

// Now we can access the scene from `xb.scene`;
// This is a standard THREE.Scene object.
xb.scene;
```
