# XR Blocks

### Description

**XR Blocks** is a lightweight, cross-platform library for rapidly prototyping
advanced XR and AI experiences. Built upon [three.js](https://threejs.org), it
targets Chrome v136+ with WebXR support on Android XR and also includes a
powerful desktop simulator for development. The framework emphasizes a
user-centric, developer-friendly SDK designed to simplify the creation of
immersive applications with features like:

-   **Hand Tracking & Gestures:** Access advanced hand tracking, custom
    gestures with TensorFlow Lite / LiteRT models, and interaction events.
-   **World Understanding:** Present samples with depth sensing, geometry-aware
    physics, and object recognition with Gemini in both XR and desktop.
-   **AI Integration:** Seamlessly connect to Gemini for multimodal
    understanding and live conversational experiences.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Write once and deploy to both XR devices and desktop
    browsers.
